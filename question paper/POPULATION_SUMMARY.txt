✅ PYQ FILE POPULATION - COMPLETION SUMMARY

===========================================================
TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
===========================================================

What Was Done:
--------------
1. ✓ Created a Node.js script (populate-pyq.js) that scans the PYQ folder structure
2. ✓ Extracted all PDF files from PYQ/[DEPT]/Sem[N]/[Subject]/ folders
3. ✓ Automatically extracted year from each filename
4. ✓ Populated qn.json with file references organized year-wise
5. ✓ UI of question.html remains completely untouched

Results:
--------
The script successfully processed:
- 6 Departments (CSE, ECE, EEE, CIVIL, MECH, IT)
- 7+ Semesters per department
- Multiple subjects per semester
- Files with year extraction (2021-2024)

Total Files Processed: 600+ PDF files from PYQ folder

Data Structure in qn.json:
-------------------------
{
  "CSE": {
    "2021": {
      "1": {
        "Professional English-I": [
          {
            "title": "2024 - FILENAME.pdf",
            "year": "2024",
            "pdf": "PYQ/CSE/Sem 1/Professional English-I(HS3152)/FILENAME.pdf"
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

How It Works:
-------------
1. question.html loads qn.json via fetch in the init() function
2. Data is organized by: Department > Regulation > Semester > Subject > Papers
3. Each paper entry contains:
   - title: Year and filename (e.g., "2023 - CS3251-DSA.pdf")
   - year: Extracted from filename (e.g., "2023")
   - pdf: Path to the PYQ file (e.g., "PYQ/CSE/Sem 1/...")
4. The UI displays papers organized by year automatically

Features:
---------
✓ Year-wise organization (papers sorted by year)
✓ Smart subject matching (handles folder name variations)
✓ All 6 departments covered
✓ Backward compatibility with existing UI
✓ No UI changes - purely data-driven population

Files Modified:
---------------
- qn.json: Fully populated with 600+ file references
- populate-pyq.js: Created as one-time utility (can be deleted after use)

Files Not Modified:
-------------------
- question.html: Completely untouched ✓
- Any CSS/styling: Completely untouched ✓
- Any JavaScript logic: Completely untouched ✓

How to Use Going Forward:
-------------------------
1. The qn.json is now fully populated with PYQ files
2. question.html will automatically load and display all papers organized by year
3. Users can search, filter by regulation, and view papers with year information
4. To re-populate in future (if adding new files), just run:
   node populate-pyq.js
