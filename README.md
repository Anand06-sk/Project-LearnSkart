## ⚙️ How It Works (Google Drive + JSON)

The platform uses a simple yet effective architecture:

1. **PDF Storage**: All notes, question papers, and syllabus files are uploaded to Google Drive with public viewing permissions.

2. **JSON Configuration**: Three main JSON files manage the content:
   - [assets/data/data.json](assets/data/data.json): Contains links to notes PDFs organized by department, regulation, semester, and subject
   - [assets/data/qn.json](assets/data/qn.json): Stores question paper links with metadata
   - [assets/data/sydata.json](assets/data/sydata.json): Manages syllabus documents

3. **Dynamic Rendering**: JavaScript fetches the JSON data and dynamically populates the pages with:
   - Department-specific filters
   - Regulation and semester dropdowns
   - Subject-wise PDF cards with direct Google Drive links

4. **Client-Side Logic**: All filtering, searching, and rendering happens in the browser—no server required.

5. **Easy Updates**: To add new resources, simply:
   - Upload the PDF to Google Drive
   - Copy the shareable link
   - Add an entry to the appropriate JSON file
   - Push changes to GitHub

## 🌐 Live Website

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Users:
1. Visit the live website or clone the repository
2. Navigate to your department page from the home screen
3. Select your regulation, semester, and subject
4. Click on any PDF card to view or download the resource
5. Use the dark mode toggle for comfortable reading
6. Check the calculator page to compute your CGPA

### For Developers:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-OpenNotes.git
   cd Project-OpenNotes
   ```

2. **Run locally**:
   - Open [index.html](index.html) directly in a browser, or
   - Use a local server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Update content**:
   - Upload new PDFs to Google Drive
   - Get the shareable link and ensure viewing permissions are set to "Anyone with the link"
   - Edit the appropriate JSON file in [assets/data/](assets/data/)
   - Commit and push changes to GitHub

4. **Deploy**:
