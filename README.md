## ⚙️ How It Works (Google Drive + JSON)

The platform uses a simple yet effective architecture:

1. **PDF Storage**: All notes, question papers, and syllabus files are uploaded to Google Drive with public viewing permissions.

2. **JSON Configuration**: Three main JSON files manage the content:
   - [assets/data/data.json](assets/data/data.json): Contains links to notes PDFs organized by department, regulation, semester, and subject
   - [assets/data/qn.json](assets/data/qn.json): Stores question paper links with metadata
   - [assets/data/sydata.json](assets/data/sydata.json): Manages syllabus documents

3. **Dynamic Rendering**: JavaScript fetches the JSON data and dynamically populates the pages with:
   - Department-specific filters
   - Regulation and semester dropdowns
   - Subject-wise PDF cards with direct Google Drive links

4. **Client-Side Logic**: All filtering, searching, and rendering happens in the browser—no server required.

5. **Easy Updates**: To add new resources, simply:
   - Upload the PDF to Google Drive
   - Copy the shareable link
   - Add an entry to the appropriate JSON file
   - Push changes to GitHub
